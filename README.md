This repo contains code to assist in UV printing onto Victornox swiss army knives in a Roland BD-8 UV printer.  

The .scad files are used to generate the .stl files for jigs required to position the knives in the printer.

The .jsx file usees Adobe Illustrators scripting API to generate the PFD files sent to the printer, applying text sizing and positioning, color, and primer layers dynamically based upon a custom GUI input.
